        Mariam is a student he born 33/33/3333 he is clever and good at studying
        but if anyone went to school that means that he will change the world? I
        think we don't need Albert Einstein to tell you to answer but there is a
        philosophy spin in my mind if an unknown person told you you can do
        something your grandparents couldn't do and you can change your life and
        world will you believe me? let's talk about Adam just think of him he
        will dream to ride a Ferrari till he dies do you know why he will not
        ride it ? because his sister ignore a chance when she was a teenager
        look at your brother you are his role model tell me how he will look at
        you when he grows will be the same when he is living in a palace you are
        the owner of it? can you go any place you want in this world?do you like
        living in Belbeis? what is the feeling to have a special financial
        liability? I think it's a good feeling, anyway you have the decision
        choose what your heart tells you, take your time in thinking the chance
        comes once, Choose a leader that will lead you to the place you want
